This is downloadable demo code related to my tutorial [Setup Link Functionality with Functional Programming](https://goo.gl/dSTfD9).  Feel free download/clone it and use it as you see fit.

You would have to grab the node modules by running either `yarn install` or `npm install`. And you can serve the code as a website from the `build` folder without a local server setup, but it would ~probably~ look cooler if you did. I didn't install a server setup, but you can use whatever method you want to run a server from inside `build`. But if you open `build/index.html` in a browser without running a local server and clicked its links, you would be able to understand how all this works.
